# Note: This is a rare condition, but it happened once and I had to do this to complete it. So here it is!

# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

# Install global Composer packages
/usr/local/bin/composer global require laravel/installer laravel/valet spatie/http-status-check bramus/mixed-content-scan

# Install Laravel Valet
$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin/valet install
# cd into ~/Sites

# Install global NPM packages
npm install --global yarn

# Create a Sites directory
# This is a default directory for macOS user accounts but doesn't comes pre-installed
mkdir $HOME/Sites
cd $HOME/Sites
$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin/valet park
cd $HOME/.dotfiles
